# Waste Listing Creation Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive "Waste Listing Creation" feature in the Sirkulo React
Native app that allows users to create, post, and manage waste material listings
for sale or disposal. This feature will integrate with the existing three-mode
user system (Customer, Business, Recycler), backend waste management
infrastructure, and established navigation patterns to enable users to
contribute to the circular economy marketplace.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Waste Listing Form Data Models and Validation**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Define TypeScript interfaces for waste listing creation forms,
     extending existing WasteType enum and backend types from
     sirkulo-backend\src\types\index.ts:27
   - Files: `src/types/wasteListingForm.ts`,
     `src/utils/wasteListingValidation.ts`, `src/constants/wasteListingForm.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Develop Waste Listing Creation Form Components**

4. **Create Waste Listing Creation Screen and Navigation**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2, 3
   - Notes: Implement main creation screen following existing navigation
     patterns from app\(tabs)\_layout.tsx and modal patterns from
     src\features\home\GarbageSection.tsx:95
   - Files: `app/create-listing.tsx`,
     `src/features/waste/CreateWasteListing.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Implement Location Services Integration**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Add location selection and address input using GeoLocation interface
     from sirkulo-backend\src\types\index.ts:81
   - Files: `src/services/locationService.ts`,
     `src/components/location/LocationSelector.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Develop User Mode Access Control**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Implement role-based access control building upon existing UserMode
     system from src\constants\chat.ts:3 and UserRole enum from
     sirkulo-backend\src\types\index.ts:8
   - Files: `src/utils/userModePermissions.ts`, `src/hooks/useUserModeAccess.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Create Waste Listing Draft Management**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Add draft saving and restoration functionality for incomplete
     listings
   - Files: `src/services/draftService.ts`, `src/hooks/useDraftListing.ts`,
     `src/context/DraftContext.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Implement Backend Integration and API Services**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 4
   - Notes: Connect to backend waste listing creation endpoints building upon
     existing ApiResponse interface from sirkulo-backend\src\types\index.ts:89
   - Files: `src/services/wasteListingCreationService.ts`,
     `src/api/wasteListingApi.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Add Form Validation and Error Handling**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2, 8
   - Notes: Implement comprehensive validation for waste listing data and user
     feedback for errors
   - Files: `src/utils/formValidation.ts`,
     `src/components/feedback/ValidationErrors.tsx`,
     `src/hooks/useFormValidation.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Integrate with Existing Profile and Listing Management**
    - Dependencies: Task 4, 8
    - Notes: Connect created listings to user profile building upon existing
      profile patterns from app\(tabs)\profile.tsx:56
    - Files: `src/features/profile/UserListings.tsx`,
      `src/components/profile/ListingHistory.tsx`
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Implement Success Flow and Confirmation**
    - Dependencies: Task 4, 8, 10
    - Notes: Add listing creation confirmation and success navigation patterns
    - Files: `src/components/feedback/ListingSuccess.tsx`,
      `src/navigation/listingFlowNavigation.ts`
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Add Integration with Cart and Purchase Flow**
    - Dependencies: Task 8, 10
    - Notes: Connect created listings with existing cart functionality from
      src\context\CartContext.tsx:163
    - Files: `src/hooks/useListingToCart.ts`, integration with existing cart
      patterns
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- Users can successfully create waste listings with all required fields (title,
  description, price, quantity, location, images)
- Form validation prevents submission of incomplete or invalid data
- Image upload functionality works reliably with proper compression and format
  validation
- Location services integrate smoothly with address selection and geolocation
- Draft saving allows users to resume incomplete listings
- Created listings appear in user profile and marketplace browsing sections
- Backend integration properly handles listing creation with appropriate error
  responses
- Role-based access control restricts listing creation based on user mode
  permissions
- Success confirmation provides clear feedback and navigation options
- Integration with existing cart and purchase flows maintains consistency

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Image Upload Performance and Storage Limitations** Mitigation: Implement
   image compression, format validation, and progressive upload with retry
   mechanisms

2. **Location Services Privacy and Accuracy Concerns** Mitigation: Implement
   optional location sharing with manual address input fallback and clear
   privacy controls

3. **Form Complexity and User Experience Degradation** Mitigation: Use
   progressive disclosure, step-by-step wizard approach, and comprehensive draft
   saving

4. **Backend API Integration Failures** Mitigation: Implement robust error
   handling, offline draft storage, and retry mechanisms with user feedback

5. **User Mode Permission Conflicts** Mitigation: Clear role-based access
   control with informative messaging about required permissions

6. **Data Validation and Security Vulnerabilities** Mitigation: Implement both
   client-side and server-side validation with sanitization and rate limiting

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Wizard-Based Multi-Step Form**: Break listing creation into multiple steps
   with progress indicators instead of single-page form
2. **Template-Based Creation**: Provide pre-filled templates for common waste
   types to simplify the creation process
3. **Voice-to-Text Integration**: Add voice input capabilities for description
   and title fields to improve accessibility
4. **AI-Assisted Categorization**: Implement automatic waste type detection
   based on uploaded images
5. **Bulk Listing Creation**: Allow users to create multiple similar listings
   simultaneously for efficiency
