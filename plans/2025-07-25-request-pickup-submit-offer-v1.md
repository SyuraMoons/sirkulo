# Request Pickup/Submit Offer Implementation Plan

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive "Request Pickup/Submit Offer" system in the Sirkulo React Native app that enables users to request waste pickup services and submit offers for recycling projects. This feature will build upon the existing user role system, cart functionality, and backend pickup bid infrastructure to create seamless request-offer workflows for Customer, Business, and Recycler modes.

   - Status: Not Started

3. **Implement Pickup Request System**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Create pickup request functionality for Customers and Businesses to request waste collection services
   - Files: `src/features/requests/PickupRequest.tsx`, `src/features/requests/RequestDetails.tsx`, `src/features/requests/RequestHistory.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Create Offer Submission System**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Implement offer submission for Recyclers to bid on pickup requests and propose upcycling projects
   - Files: `src/features/offers/OfferSubmission.tsx`, `src/features/offers/BidManagement.tsx`, `src/features/offers/ProjectProposal.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Integrate Request/Offer with Existing Cart System**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4
   - Notes: Extend existing cart functionality to support pickup requests and offer management
   - Files: `src/context/CartContext.tsx` (enhanced), request/offer cart integration
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Implement Request-Offer Matching System**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4
   - Notes: Create system for matching pickup requests with recycler offers and managing bid workflows
   - Files: `src/features/matching/RequestOfferMatcher.tsx`, `src/features/matching/BidComparison.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Create Real-time Notification System**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4, 6
   - Notes: Add notifications for request status updates, new offers, and bid acceptance/rejection
   - Files: `src/features/notifications/RequestNotifications.tsx`, `src/features/notifications/OfferNotifications.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Implement Location-Based Request/Offer System**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4
   - Notes: Add location-based pickup requests and proximity-based offer matching
   - Files: `src/features/requests/LocationPicker.tsx`, `src/features/offers/ProximityMatcher.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Create Request/Offer Management Dashboard**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4, 6, 7
   - Notes: Build comprehensive dashboard for managing active requests, submitted offers, and bid status
   - Files: `src/features/dashboard/RequestDashboard.tsx`, `src/features/dashboard/OfferDashboard.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Integrate with User Role-Specific Workflows**
    - Dependencies: Task 3, 4, 9
    - Notes: Customize request/offer features based on user mode (Customer, Business, Recycler) capabilities
    - Files: Role-specific request/offer components, user mode integration
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Implement Backend API Integration**
    - Dependencies: Task 1, 3, 4, 6
    - Notes: Connect frontend with existing backend pickup bid system and request/offer endpoints
    - Files: `src/services/requestService.ts`, `src/services/offerService.ts`, API integration
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Create Request/Offer Analytics and Reporting**
    - Dependencies: Task 9, 11
    - Notes: Add analytics for request success rates, offer performance, and user engagement metrics
    - Files: `src/features/analytics/RequestAnalytics.tsx`, `src/features/analytics/OfferAnalytics.tsx`
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Users can submit pickup requests with detailed waste information, location, and scheduling preferences
- Recyclers can submit competitive offers and bids for pickup requests with pricing and service details
- Request-offer matching system efficiently connects requesters with suitable service providers
- Real-time notifications keep users informed about request status and new offer submissions
- Location-based functionality enables proximity-based request and offer matching
- Integration with existing cart system maintains current user workflows and patterns
- User role customization provides appropriate features for Customer, Business, and Recycler modes
- Backend integration leverages existing pickup bid infrastructure efficiently
- Analytics and reporting provide insights into request/offer success rates and user engagement
- All features follow existing app design patterns and accessibility standards

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Complex Request-Offer Matching Algorithm Performance**
   Mitigation: Implement efficient matching algorithms with caching and background processing for large-scale operations

2. **Real-time Notification System Complexity**
   Mitigation: Use established notification patterns with user-configurable preferences and efficient delivery mechanisms

3. **Integration Disruption with Existing Cart System**
   Mitigation: Extend existing cart patterns rather than replacing, maintain backward compatibility with current functionality

4. **Location Privacy and Security Concerns**
   Mitigation: Implement user-controlled location sharing with approximate location options and secure data handling

5. **User Role Workflow Complexity**
   Mitigation: Design clear role-based interfaces with progressive disclosure and contextual guidance for each user mode

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Simplified Request-Response System**: Focus on basic request submission and manual offer review rather than automated matching
2. **Chat-Based Negotiation**: Integrate request/offer system with existing chat functionality for direct communication and negotiation
3. **Marketplace-Style Bidding**: Create auction-style bidding system for pickup requests with time-limited offers
4. **Template-Based Requests**: Provide predefined request templates for common waste types and pickup scenarios
5. **AI-Powered Matching**: Use machine learning algorithms for intelligent request-offer matching based on user preferences and historical data
