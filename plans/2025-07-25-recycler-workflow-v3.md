# Recycler Workflow Implementation Plan - Enhanced Waste Acquisition Process

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive recycler workflow in the Sirkulo React Native app that
addresses all key recycler interaction points with detailed waste acquisition
process: viewing available waste listings, refining listings by criteria,
viewing detailed listing information, requesting pickup and initiating waste
collection, and submitting offers for buying waste. This plan creates an
integrated recycler journey from waste discovery and acquisition to processed
material distribution with emphasis on efficiency, transparency, and circular
economy optimization.
