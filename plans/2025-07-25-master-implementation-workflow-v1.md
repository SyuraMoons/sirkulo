   - Implement features according to phase plan
   - Maintain cross-feature integration

3. **Friday: Integration and Testing**
   - Test feature integration
   - Validate cross-mode functionality
   - Update documentation

### Cross-Feature Integration Guidelines

1. **User Mode Consistency**

### Quality Assurance Workflow

1. **Feature-Level Testing**
   - Unit tests for all new components
   - Integration tests for feature workflows
   - User acceptance testing for each feature

2. **Cross-Feature Testing**
   - Test interactions between features
   - Validate user mode switching with new features
   - Performance testing with multiple features active

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Ensure existing functionality remains intact
   - Test core workflows after each feature addition
   - Validate data consistency across features

## Risk Management and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Feature Complexity Overwhelming Codebase**

2. **Performance Degradation with Feature Addition**
   - Mitigation: Continuous performance monitoring and optimization

3. **Integration Conflicts Between Features**
   - Mitigation: Clear API contracts and integration testing

### Project Management Risks

1. **Scope Creep and Feature Bloat**
