# Recycler Workflow Implementation Plan - Complete with Business Project Collaboration

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive recycler workflow in the Sirkulo React Native app that
addresses all key recycler interaction points with complete waste acquisition,
collection process, and business project collaboration: viewing available waste
listings, refining listings by criteria, viewing detailed listing information,
requesting pickup and initiating waste collection, submitting offers for buying
waste, viewing scheduled pickups, marking as picked up, uploading proof of
collection, requesting payment, accessing business project dashboard, choosing
aligned projects, creating detailed proposals, awaiting decisions, receiving
approval notifications, and beginning approved projects. This plan creates an
integrated recycler journey from waste discovery and acquisition to collection
completion, payment processing, and collaborative business project execution
with emphasis on efficiency, transparency, and circular economy optimization.

   protocols

4. **Project Execution Coordination and Management** Mitigation: Integrated
   project management tools, progress tracking systems, and milestone management

5. **Financial Integration Between Waste Operations and Project Work**
   Mitigation: Unified financial tracking, separate revenue streams, and
   comprehensive profitability analysis

6. **Resource Allocation Between Core Operations and Project Work** Mitigation:

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Simplified Project Collaboration**: Focus on basic project discovery and
   execution without advanced matching
2. **Proposal-Centric Model**: Emphasize proposal quality and competitive
   bidding over skill matching
3. **Partnership-First Approach**: Prioritize long-term business relationships
   over individual project opportunities
4. **Specialization Focus**: Concentrate on specific project types or industries
   rather than broad collaboration
5. **Automated Matching**: Use AI-driven project assignment rather than manual
   selection and proposal processes
6. **Integration-Optimized**: Focus on seamless integration with existing waste
   operations over standalone project features
7. **Performance-Driven Model**: Emphasize project success metrics and
   performance tracking over discovery and proposal features
