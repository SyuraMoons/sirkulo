# Recycler Workflow Implementation Plan - Complete Waste Acquisition and Collection Process

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive recycler workflow in the Sirkulo React Native app that
addresses all key recycler interaction points with complete waste acquisition
and collection process: viewing available waste listings, refining listings by
criteria, viewing detailed listing information, requesting pickup and initiating
waste collection, submitting offers for buying waste, viewing scheduled pickups,
marking as picked up, uploading proof of collection, and requesting payment
through project proposal process. This plan creates an integrated recycler
journey from waste discovery and acquisition to collection completion and
payment processing with emphasis on efficiency, transparency, and circular
economy optimization.

   payment gateways, escrow services, and fraud detection systems

3. **Schedule Management and Coordination Complexity** Mitigation: Automated
   scheduling algorithms, real-time synchronization, and conflict resolution
   tools

4. **Proof of Collection Data Integrity and Authenticity** Mitigation:
   Cryptographic signing, timestamp verification, and immutable documentation
   storage

5. **Project Proposal and Invoice Accuracy** Mitigation: Automated calculation
   systems, approval workflows, and audit trail maintenance

6. **Collection Team Coordination and Communication** Mitigation: Real-time
   communication tools, mobile app integration, and automated status updates
