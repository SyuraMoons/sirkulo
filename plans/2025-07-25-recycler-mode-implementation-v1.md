# Recycler Mode Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive Recycler mode interface in the Sirkulo React Native
app that enables recyclers to manage waste collection, processing workflows, and
business operations. This feature will transform the current placeholder into a
fully functional recycler dashboard with waste management tools, pickup
scheduling, and processing tracking capabilities.

     `src/features/recycler/CollectionMap.tsx`,
     `src/features/recycler/PickupHistory.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Create Waste Processing Workflow**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Add processing stages tracking, quality assessment, and output
     management
   - Files: `src/features/recycler/ProcessingWorkflow.tsx`,
     `src/features/recycler/QualityControl.tsx`,
     `src/features/recycler/OutputInventory.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Replace Recycler Mode Placeholder**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 3
   - Notes: Replace "Coming Soon" placeholder with functional recycler dashboard
     in main index screen
   - Files: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Implement Recycler Profile Management**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Extend existing profile system with recycler-specific features like
     specialization, certifications, and experience
   - Files: `src/features/recycler/RecyclerProfile.tsx`,
     `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` integration
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Create Waste Type and Category Management**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 4
   - Notes: Implement waste categorization system using existing WasteType enum
     and processing capabilities
   - Files: `src/features/recycler/WasteCategories.tsx`,
     `src/features/recycler/MaterialSpecs.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Add Business Partnership Interface**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 4, 7
   - Notes: Enable recyclers to connect with businesses for waste collection and
     processed material sales
   - Files: `src/features/recycler/BusinessPartners.tsx`,
     `src/features/recycler/MaterialMarketplace.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Implement Recycler Analytics and Reporting**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 3, 4
   - Notes: Add performance metrics, environmental impact tracking, and business
     analytics
   - Files: `src/features/recycler/RecyclerAnalytics.tsx`,
     `src/features/recycler/ImpactReports.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Create Pickup Bid Management System**
    - Dependencies: Task 3, 8
    - Notes: Implement bidding system for waste pickup requests from businesses
      and customers
    - Files: `src/features/recycler/PickupBids.tsx`,
      `src/features/recycler/BidManagement.tsx`
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Integrate with Backend Recycler APIs**
    - Dependencies: Task 1, 2, 3, 4
    - Notes: Connect frontend components with existing backend recycler
      endpoints and profile system
    - Files: `src/services/recyclerService.ts`, API integration files
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Add Recycler Navigation and User Experience**
    - Dependencies: Task 2, 5, 6
    - Notes: Ensure seamless navigation between recycler features and maintain
      consistency with existing app patterns
    - Files: Navigation components, user experience optimization
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- Recycler mode displays a functional dashboard replacing the current "Coming
  Soon" placeholder
- Waste collection management allows scheduling, tracking, and managing pickup
  operations
- Processing workflow enables recyclers to track waste through transformation
  stages
- Integration with existing user role system maintains smooth mode switching
  functionality
- Recycler profile management extends current profile system with specialization
  and certification tracking
- Business partnership features enable collaboration between recyclers and waste
  providers
- Analytics and reporting provide insights into recycler performance and
  environmental impact
- Pickup bid system allows competitive waste collection pricing and scheduling
- All features follow existing app design patterns and user experience standards
- Performance remains optimal with complex recycler workflow management

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Complex Workflow Management Integration** Mitigation: Start with essential
   waste processing stages, gradually expand workflow complexity based on user
   feedback

2. **Real-time Location and Route Optimization** Mitigation: Implement efficient
   location services and offline capability for pickup route management

3. **Integration Complexity with Existing User System** Mitigation: Extend
   existing user role patterns and profile system rather than creating separate
   architecture

4. **Data Synchronization for Processing Workflows** Mitigation: Implement
   robust state management and offline support for critical recycler operations

5. **Business Partnership Complexity** Mitigation: Start with basic partnership
   features, expand marketplace functionality based on adoption

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Workflow-First Design**: Organize recycler interface around processing
   workflows rather than dashboard-centric design
2. **Map-Centric Interface**: Use location and route mapping as the primary
   interface for pickup and collection management
3. **Simplified Recycler Mode**: Focus on essential pickup scheduling and basic
   processing tracking without complex workflow management
4. **Marketplace Integration**: Emphasize material sales and business
   partnerships over internal processing workflow
5. **Mobile-Optimized Operations**: Design specifically for field operations
   with offline-first functionality and simplified interfaces
