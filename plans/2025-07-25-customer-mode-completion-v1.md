## Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. **Feature Complexity Overwhelming Existing Simple Interface**
   Mitigation: Implement progressive disclosure and maintain clean, simple UI with advanced features accessible but not prominent

2. **Performance Impact from Additional Features**
   Mitigation: Use lazy loading, efficient caching, and modular architecture to maintain app performance

3. **User Experience Consistency Across New Features**
   Mitigation: Follow existing design patterns and maintain consistent styling and interaction patterns

4. **Backend Integration Complexity for New Features**
   Mitigation: Build upon existing API patterns and implement features incrementally with proper error handling

5. **Customer Workflow Disruption from New Features**
   Mitigation: Make all new features optional and maintain existing workflows while adding enhancements

## Alternative Approaches
1. **Minimal Enhancement**: Focus only on search improvements and product details without additional features
2. **Mobile-First Simplicity**: Prioritize essential features like checkout and order tracking over advanced features
3. **Sustainability-Focused**: Emphasize environmental impact and sustainability features over general e-commerce features
4. **Social-First Approach**: Focus on community and sharing features to build engagement around sustainability
5. **AI-Enhanced Experience**: Integrate AI-powered recommendations and insights as the primary enhancement strategy
