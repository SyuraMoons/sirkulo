# Recycler Workflow Implementation Plan - Complete with Enhanced Public Dashboard

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive recycler workflow in the Sirkulo React Native app that
addresses all key recycler interaction points with complete waste acquisition,
collection process, business project collaboration, and enhanced public
dashboard showcase: viewing available waste listings, refining listings by
criteria, viewing detailed listing information, requesting pickup and initiating
waste collection, submitting offers for buying waste, viewing scheduled pickups,
marking as picked up, uploading proof of collection, requesting payment,
accessing business project dashboard, choosing aligned projects, creating
detailed proposals, awaiting decisions, receiving approval notifications,
beginning approved projects, maintaining a comprehensive public dashboard with
reputation badge earning, highlighted reviews, completed project counting,
rating summaries, and dashboard access management. This plan creates an
integrated recycler journey from waste discovery and acquisition to collection
completion, payment processing, collaborative business project execution, and
enhanced public community engagement with emphasis on efficiency, transparency,
reputation building, and circular economy optimization.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Reputation System Gaming and Manipulation** Mitigation: Robust verification
   systems, authentic achievement criteria, and anti-gaming algorithms

2. **Review Authenticity and Verification Challenges** Mitigation: Customer
   verification systems, project-based review linking, and fraud detection
   mechanisms

3. **Rating System Bias and Unfair Ratings** Mitigation: Rating verification
   processes, dispute resolution systems, and balanced rating algorithms

4. **Privacy vs. Transparency Balance** Mitigation: Granular privacy controls,
   selective information sharing, and professional guidance systems

5. **Dashboard Performance with Rich Content** Mitigation: Optimized loading
   strategies, content delivery networks, and progressive enhancement

6. **Professional Presentation Standards and Quality** Mitigation: Professional
   templates, content guidelines, and quality assurance systems

7. **Data Accuracy and Real-Time Synchronization** Mitigation: Automated data
   synchronization, verification systems, and accuracy monitoring

8. **Competitive Information Protection** Mitigation: Strategic information
   sharing controls and competitive data protection mechanisms

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Simplified Reputation System**: Focus on basic ratings without advanced
   badge and achievement systems
2. **Review-Centric Dashboard**: Emphasize customer testimonials over
   operational metrics and achievements
3. **Performance-Focused Display**: Prioritize operational statistics over
   social proof and community engagement
4. **Industry-Specific Dashboards**: Create specialized dashboards for different
   recycling industry sectors
5. **Social Media Integration**: Focus on external social media presence rather
   than integrated dashboard features
6. **Marketplace-Embedded Profiles**: Integrate public dashboard within
   marketplace listings rather than standalone presence
7. **Certification-Driven Presentation**: Organize dashboard around
   certifications and compliance rather than performance metrics
