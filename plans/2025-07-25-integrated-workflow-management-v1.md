   Configurable automation rules with manual override capabilities and adaptive
   learning

4. **Integration Complexity Across Multiple User Modes** Mitigation:
   Standardized interfaces, comprehensive testing, and gradual integration
   rollout

5. **Security Vulnerabilities in Cross-System Communication** Mitigation:
   End-to-end encryption, access control, and comprehensive security monitoring

6. **Performance Impact from Real-Time Workflow Coordination** Mitigation:
   Efficient caching, asynchronous processing, and optimized data structures

   without advanced orchestration
2. **Mode-Specific Workflows**: Maintain separate workflows with minimal
   integration between user modes
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use event-based coordination instead of
   centralized workflow orchestration
4. **API-First Integration**: Prioritize external system integration over
   internal workflow coordination
5. **Manual Coordination Focus**: Emphasize human decision-making over automated
   workflow management
6. **Performance-Optimized Workflows**: Prioritize system performance over
   comprehensive workflow features
7. **Security-First Workflow Design**: Organize workflow around security and
   compliance requirements
