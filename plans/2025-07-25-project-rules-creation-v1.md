# Sirkulo Project Rules and Standards

## Objective

Establish comprehensive development rules and coding standards for the Sirkulo
React Native/Expo project to ensure code consistency, maintainability, and team
collaboration efficiency.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze Current Codebase Patterns and Establish Baseline**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Document existing patterns in components, constants, types, and
     project structure
   - Files: `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, pattern analysis document
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Create File and Folder Organization Rules**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Formalize the src/ directory structure and establish naming
     conventions
   - Files: `PROJECT_RULES.md`, folder structure guidelines
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Define TypeScript and Code Quality Standards**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Establish TypeScript best practices, interface naming, and type
     safety rules
   - Files: TypeScript guidelines, ESLint configuration
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Establish Component Development Guidelines**
   - Dependencies: Tasks 1, 3
   - Notes: Define component structure, props interfaces, styling patterns, and
     export conventions
   - Files: Component development guide, component templates
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Create Import/Export and Dependency Management Rules**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Standardize import order, absolute vs relative paths, and barrel
     export patterns
   - Files: Import guidelines, dependency management rules
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Define Git Workflow and Development Process Rules**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Establish commit message format, branch naming, PR guidelines, and
     development workflow
   - Files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, git workflow documentation
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Create Testing and Quality Assurance Standards**
   - Dependencies: Tasks 3, 4
   - Notes: Define testing patterns, coverage requirements, and QA processes
   - Files: Testing guidelines, QA checklist
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Configure Automated Rule Enforcement Tools**
   - Dependencies: Tasks 3, 5
   - Notes: Set up ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks, and TypeScript
     strict mode
   - Files: `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc`, `package.json` scripts, Husky
     configuration
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Create Performance and Optimization Guidelines**
   - Dependencies: Task 4
   - Notes: Establish rules for bundle size, image optimization, and performance
     best practices
   - Files: Performance guidelines, optimization checklist
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Document Rule Enforcement and Violation Handling**
    - Dependencies: All previous tasks
    - Notes: Create process for handling rule violations and updating standards
    - Files: Rule enforcement documentation, violation handling process
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- All current code patterns are documented and formalized into rules
- File and folder organization follows consistent naming conventions
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled with comprehensive type coverage
- Component development follows standardized patterns and interfaces
- Import/export conventions are consistently applied across the codebase
- Git workflow is clearly defined with automated enforcement
- Testing standards are established with coverage requirements
- Automated tools enforce rules without manual intervention
- Performance guidelines prevent common optimization issues
- Rule violation process is clear and actionable

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Existing Code Not Conforming to New Rules** Mitigation: Gradual
   implementation with legacy code exemptions and refactoring plan

2. **Over-Engineering Rule Complexity** Mitigation: Start with essential rules
   and add complexity gradually based on team needs

3. **Developer Resistance to Strict Rules** Mitigation: Involve team in rule
   creation process and provide clear rationale for each rule

4. **Automated Tools Breaking Development Workflow** Mitigation: Thorough
   testing of automation tools and fallback procedures

5. **Rules Becoming Outdated with Technology Changes** Mitigation: Regular
   review and update process for rules and standards

6. **Performance Impact from Rule Enforcement Tools** Mitigation: Optimize tool
   configurations and consider development vs production environments

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Minimal Rule Set**: Focus only on critical rules for code organization and
   TypeScript
2. **Gradual Implementation**: Introduce rules incrementally over multiple
   development cycles
3. **Team-Driven Standards**: Collaborative rule creation with team input and
   consensus
4. **Tool-First Approach**: Implement automated tools first, then document the
   enforced patterns
5. **Documentation-Only**: Create guidelines without automated enforcement for
   flexibility

## Rule Categories to Address

### Code Organization

- Folder structure and naming conventions
- File naming patterns (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)
- Feature-based architecture maintenance
- Asset organization and optimization

### TypeScript Standards

- Interface vs type usage patterns
- Strict mode enforcement
- Type export and import conventions
- Generic type usage guidelines

### Component Development

- Component structure and organization
- Props interface definitions
- Default export vs named export patterns
- Styling and theme usage

### Import/Export Conventions

- Absolute path usage with @/src/ prefix
- Import order standardization
- Barrel export patterns for features
- Dependency management rules

### Git and Development Workflow

- Commit message format and conventions
- Branch naming standards
- Pull request requirements
- Code review guidelines

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Test file organization and naming
- Coverage requirements and reporting
- Testing patterns for components and hooks
- Quality gates for deployment

### Performance and Optimization

- Bundle size monitoring
- Image and asset optimization
- Lazy loading patterns
- Memory usage guidelines
