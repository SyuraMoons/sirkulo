# Consumer Experience Workflow Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive consumer experience workflow in the Sirkulo React
Native app that addresses all key customer interaction points: consumer
dashboard, product exploration, filtering options, detailed product pages,
material origin tracking, wishlist/purchase functionality, and verified business
interactions. This plan creates an integrated customer journey from discovery to
purchase with emphasis on transparency, sustainability, and trust.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Consumer Experience Complexity Overwhelming Simple Shopping** Mitigation:
   Progressive disclosure with simple default views and advanced features
   accessible on demand

2. **Material Origin Data Accuracy and Verification** Mitigation: Implement
   robust verification processes and clear data source attribution with audit
   trails

3. **Business Verification System Trust and Reliability** Mitigation:
   Multi-level verification with clear criteria, regular audits, and transparent
   verification processes

4. **Performance Impact from Rich Consumer Experience Features** Mitigation:
   Efficient loading strategies, caching, and progressive enhancement for
   complex features

5. **User Adoption of Advanced Consumer Features** Mitigation: Clear onboarding,
   guided tours, and gradual feature introduction with educational content

6. **Integration Complexity Across Consumer Workflow** Mitigation: Modular
   architecture with clear interfaces and comprehensive integration testing

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Simplified Consumer Experience**: Focus on essential shopping features
   without advanced exploration and analytics
2. **Sustainability-First Interface**: Organize entire consumer experience
   around environmental impact and sustainability goals
3. **Social Commerce Focus**: Emphasize community features, reviews, and social
   discovery over individual consumer analytics
4. **Mobile-First Minimalism**: Streamlined mobile experience with essential
   features and progressive web enhancement
5. **AI-Driven Experience**: Use artificial intelligence as primary interface
   for discovery, recommendations, and decision support
