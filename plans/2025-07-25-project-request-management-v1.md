# Project Request Management System Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive project request management system in the Sirkulo React
Native app that enables users to post requests for specific recycling projects
(such as making chairs from plastic waste), manage project proposals, coordinate
with recyclers and manufacturers, and track project completion. This plan
creates an integrated project-based circular economy marketplace where users can
request custom recycled products and service providers can respond with
proposals and solutions.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Project Scope Creep and Requirement Changes** Mitigation: Clear
   specification protocols, change management processes, and scope protection
   mechanisms

2. **Quality Expectations vs. Reality Misalignment** Mitigation: Detailed
   specification requirements, prototype development, and quality checkpoint
   systems

3. **Intellectual Property Protection and Disputes** Mitigation: IP protection
   agreements, clear ownership terms, and legal documentation systems

4. **Payment Security and Financial Disputes** Mitigation: Escrow services,
   milestone payment systems, and structured dispute resolution

5. **Project Completion and Delivery Reliability** Mitigation: Provider
   verification, performance tracking, and backup provider networks

6. **Technical Feasibility and Material Availability** Mitigation: Feasibility
   assessment tools, material sourcing verification, and alternative solution
   planning

7. **Regulatory Compliance and Legal Requirements** Mitigation: Automated
   compliance checking, legal consultation integration, and regulatory update
   systems

8. **Communication and Coordination Complexity** Mitigation: Structured
   communication protocols, project management tools, and automated coordination
   systems

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Simplified Request System**: Focus on basic project posting without
   advanced specification and management features
2. **Auction-Based Model**: Implement competitive bidding system rather than
   proposal evaluation
3. **Template-Based Requests**: Use predefined project templates rather than
   custom specification
4. **Local Focus**: Organize system around geographic regions rather than global
   marketplace
5. **Skill-Specific Platforms**: Create specialized platforms for different
   types of recycling projects
6. **Broker-Mediated Model**: Use platform intermediaries rather than direct
   client-provider interaction
7. **Community-Driven Approach**: Emphasize community collaboration over
   commercial project execution
