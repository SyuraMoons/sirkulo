# Recycler Workflow Implementation Plan - Enhanced with Waste Listing Browsing

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive recycler workflow in the Sirkulo React Native app that
addresses all key recycler interaction points: waste listing browsing and
discovery, waste collection management, material processing tracking, inventory
management, business partnership coordination, sustainability impact reporting,
and marketplace integration. This plan creates an integrated recycler journey
from waste discovery and acquisition to processed material distribution with
emphasis on efficiency, transparency, and circular economy optimization.
