# Track Supported Project Implementation Plan

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive "Track Supported Project" feature in the Sirkulo React Native app that allows users to monitor, follow, and receive updates on projects they have supported through purchases, funding, or engagement. This feature will enhance user engagement by providing transparency and progress visibility for supported sustainability projects.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Project Data Model and Interfaces**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Define TypeScript interfaces for project entities, support tracking, and project progress data
   - Files: `src/types/project.ts`, `src/constants/project.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Develop Project Tracking Components**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Create reusable components for project cards, progress indicators, and project timelines
   - Files: `src/features/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`, `src/features/projects/ProjectProgress.tsx`, `src/features/projects/ProjectTimeline.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Implement Project Support History Integration**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Connect project tracking with existing purchase history and business support data from profile
   - Files: `src/features/projects/SupportHistory.tsx`, existing profile components integration
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Create Project Detail and Tracking Screen**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Detailed project view with progress tracking, milestones, impact metrics, and update feed
   - Files: `src/features/projects/ProjectDetail.tsx`, `app/project/[id].tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Integrate Project Tracking into Profile System**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 3, 4
   - Notes: Add "Supported Projects" tab to existing profile screen and update achievement system
   - Files: `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`, `src/constants/profile.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Implement Project Notification System**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 4
   - Notes: Add project update notifications for milestones, completion, and impact reports
   - Files: `src/features/notifications/ProjectNotifications.tsx`, notification service integration
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Create Project Discovery and Browsing**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 4
   - Notes: Allow users to discover new projects to support and track project recommendations
   - Files: `src/features/projects/ProjectBrowse.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/projects.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Implement Project Impact Visualization**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2, 4
   - Notes: Create charts and visualizations for environmental impact, funding progress, and sustainability metrics
   - Files: `src/features/projects/ProjectImpact.tsx`, `src/components/charts/`
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Add Project Support Actions**
   - Dependencies: Task 4, 7
   - Notes: Enable users to increase support, share projects, and engage with project updates
   - Files: Project detail components, social sharing integration
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Integrate with Backend Project APIs**
    - Dependencies: Task 1, 2, 3, 4
    - Notes: Connect frontend components with existing backend project endpoints and support tracking
    - Files: `src/services/projectService.ts`, API integration files
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Implement Real-time Project Updates**
    - Dependencies: Task 6, 10
    - Notes: Add real-time project status updates and progress synchronization
    - Files: WebSocket integration, real-time update components
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Add Project Tracking Analytics**
    - Dependencies: Task 5, 8, 10
    - Notes: Track user engagement with supported projects and provide personalized insights
    - Files: Analytics integration, user engagement tracking
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Users can view a comprehensive list of all projects they have supported through purchases or direct funding
- Project tracking displays real-time progress updates, milestones, and completion status
- Project detail screens show environmental impact metrics, funding progress, and timeline visualization
- Integration with existing profile system maintains current achievement tracking for "Business Supporter"
- Notification system alerts users to important project updates and milestones
- Project discovery allows users to find and support new sustainability projects
- Performance remains optimal with multiple tracked projects and real-time updates
- All interactions follow existing app design patterns and user experience standards
- Project support history is accurately reflected in user profile statistics

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Complex Project Data Synchronization**
   Mitigation: Implement robust data caching and offline support for project tracking data

2. **Real-time Update Performance Impact**
   Mitigation: Use efficient WebSocket connections and selective update mechanisms for active projects only

3. **Integration Complexity with Existing Profile System**
   Mitigation: Extend existing achievement and statistics systems rather than replacing them

4. **Project Data Model Complexity**
   Mitigation: Start with essential project tracking features, gradually expand based on user feedback and backend capabilities

5. **Notification Overload Risk**
   Mitigation: Implement user-configurable notification preferences and intelligent notification batching

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Widget-Based Tracking**: Create dashboard widgets for quick project status overview instead of full-screen tracking interfaces
2. **Timeline-First Design**: Organize project tracking around chronological timeline view rather than individual project cards
3. **Gamification Integration**: Add project support badges, levels, and rewards to increase user engagement with tracking
4. **Social Features Integration**: Allow users to share project support achievements and collaborate on project funding goals
5. **Minimal Tracking Approach**: Focus on basic progress indicators and completion notifications rather than comprehensive project management features
