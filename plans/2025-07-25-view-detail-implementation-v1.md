# View Detail Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive "View Detail" system in the Sirkulo React Native app
that provides detailed information views for products, waste listings,
businesses, and other items. This feature will enhance the existing card-based
displays in CraftsSection and GarbageSection with rich detail screens, building
upon the existing navigation patterns and data structures.

## Implementation Plan

   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Define comprehensive detail interfaces extending existing CraftItem
     and waste listing structures

   - Status: Not Started

2. **Develop Core Detail View Components**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Create reusable detail view components for different item types with
     image galleries and specifications
   - Files: `src/components/detail/DetailHeader.tsx`,
     `src/components/detail/ImageGallery.tsx`,
     `src/components/detail/SpecificationList.tsx`,
     `src/components/detail/ActionButtons.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Implement Product Detail Screen**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Create detailed product view building upon existing CraftItem
     structure with enhanced information display
   - Files: `src/features/products/ProductDetail.tsx`, `app/product/[id].tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Create Waste Listing Detail Screen**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Implement detailed waste listing view with seller information,
     material specifications, and interaction options
   - Files: `src/features/waste/WasteDetail.tsx`, `app/waste/[id].tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Enhance Existing Card Components with Detail Navigation**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4
   - Notes: Add touch handlers to existing CraftsSection and GarbageSection
     cards for detail navigation
   - Files: `src/features/home/CraftsSection.tsx`,
     `src/features/home/GarbageSection.tsx` (enhanced with navigation)
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Implement Business Detail Profile Screen**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Create comprehensive business detail view with verification status,
     products, and contact information
   - Files: `src/features/business/BusinessDetail.tsx`, `app/business/[id].tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Create Project Detail and Tracking Screen**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Implement detailed project view with progress tracking, impact
     metrics, and support information
   - Files: `src/features/projects/ProjectDetail.tsx`, `app/project/[id].tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Implement Detail View Image and Media System**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 3, 4
   - Notes: Add comprehensive image galleries, zoom functionality, and media
     viewing capabilities
   - Files: `src/components/detail/ImageViewer.tsx`,
     `src/components/detail/MediaGallery.tsx`,
     `src/components/detail/ZoomableImage.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Create Detail View Interaction Features**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4, 6, 7
   - Notes: Add contact seller, share, bookmark, and purchase/support actions to
     detail views
   - Files: `src/components/detail/DetailActions.tsx`,
     `src/components/detail/ShareOptions.tsx`,
     `src/components/detail/ContactSeller.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Implement Related Items and Recommendations**
    - Dependencies: Task 3, 4, 6
    - Notes: Add related products, similar listings, and personalized
      recommendations to detail views
    - Files: `src/components/detail/RelatedItems.tsx`,
      `src/components/detail/Recommendations.tsx`
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Create Detail View Navigation and Back Handling**
    - Dependencies: Task 3, 4, 6, 7
    - Notes: Implement proper navigation flow building upon existing chat detail
      pattern from `chat/[id].tsx`
    - Files: Detail navigation utilities, back button handling, navigation state
      management
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Integrate Detail Views with Backend APIs**
    - Dependencies: Task 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
    - Notes: Connect detail views with backend APIs for dynamic data loading and
      real-time updates
    - Files: `src/services/detailService.ts`, API integration for detail data
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- Detail views provide comprehensive information for all item types (products,
  waste, businesses, projects)
- Navigation from existing cards to detail views is seamless and intuitive
- Image galleries and media viewing provide excellent visual experience
- Detail view interactions enable users to contact sellers, share items, and
  take relevant actions
- Related items and recommendations enhance discovery and user engagement
- Navigation patterns follow existing app conventions and maintain consistency
- Performance remains optimal with rich detail content and media loading
- All detail views follow existing app design patterns and accessibility
  standards
- Integration with existing cart functionality maintains current user workflows
- Backend integration provides real-time data updates and accurate information

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Performance Impact with Rich Media Content** Mitigation: Implement lazy
   loading, image optimization, and progressive loading for detail views

2. **Navigation Complexity with Multiple Detail Types** Mitigation: Use
   consistent navigation patterns building upon existing chat detail
   implementation

3. **Integration Disruption with Existing Card Components** Mitigation: Extend
   existing card components with minimal changes, maintain backward
   compatibility

4. **Data Loading and Caching Complexity** Mitigation: Implement efficient data
   caching and offline support for detail view content

5. **User Experience Consistency Across Detail Types** Mitigation: Create shared
   detail view components and maintain consistent design patterns across all
   detail screens

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Modal-Based Detail Views**: Use modal overlays for detail views instead of
   full-screen navigation to maintain context
2. **Progressive Detail Loading**: Start with basic detail information and
   progressively load additional content
3. **Tabbed Detail Interface**: Organize detail information in tabs (Overview,
   Specifications, Reviews, Related) for better organization
4. **Minimal Detail Enhancement**: Enhance existing cards with expandable detail
   sections rather than separate detail screens
5. **AR/3D Detail Integration**: Include augmented reality or 3D model viewing
   for enhanced product visualization
