# Recycler Workflow Implementation Plan - Complete with Public Dashboard

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive recycler workflow in the Sirkulo React Native app that addresses all key recycler interaction points with complete waste acquisition, collection process, business project collaboration, and public dashboard showcase: viewing available waste listings, refining listings by criteria, viewing detailed listing information, requesting pickup and initiating waste collection, submitting offers for buying waste, viewing scheduled pickups, marking as picked up, uploading proof of collection, requesting payment, accessing business project dashboard, choosing aligned projects, creating detailed proposals, awaiting decisions, receiving approval notifications, beginning approved projects, and maintaining a comprehensive public dashboard showcasing recycler operations, impact, and achievements.
