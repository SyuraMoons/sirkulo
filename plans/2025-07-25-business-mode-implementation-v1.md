# Business Mode Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive Business mode interface in the Sirkulo React Native
app that enables businesses to manage waste selling operations, analytics,
marketplace activities, and sustainability reporting. This feature will
transform the current "Business Home (Coming Soon)" placeholder into a fully
functional business dashboard with waste management tools, analytics dashboard,
and business operations management capabilities.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Complex Business Analytics Performance Impact** Mitigation: Implement
   efficient data aggregation, caching strategies, and progressive loading for
   analytics dashboards

2. **Integration Complexity with Existing User System** Mitigation: Extend
   existing user role patterns and profile system rather than creating separate
   business architecture

3. **Business Data Model Complexity** Mitigation: Start with essential business
   features, gradually expand based on user feedback and backend capabilities

4. **Marketplace Integration Challenges** Mitigation: Build upon existing waste
   listing patterns and cart functionality for consistent user experience

5. **Business Verification and Trust System Complexity** Mitigation: Leverage
   existing verification patterns and start with basic trust indicators, expand
   based on adoption

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Analytics-First Design**: Organize business interface around analytics and
   reporting rather than dashboard-centric design
2. **Marketplace-Centric Interface**: Focus primarily on waste selling and
   marketplace features with simplified business management
3. **Simplified Business Mode**: Implement essential waste selling and basic
   analytics without complex business management features
4. **Integration-Heavy Approach**: Emphasize integration with existing Customer
   and Recycler modes rather than standalone business features
5. **SaaS-Style Dashboard**: Create enterprise-grade business intelligence
   dashboard with advanced analytics and reporting capabilities
