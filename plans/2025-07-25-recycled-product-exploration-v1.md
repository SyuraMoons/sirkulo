## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Exploration Feature Complexity Overwhelming Simple Product Browsing**
   Mitigation: Implement progressive disclosure with simple default view and
   advanced features accessible on demand

2. **Performance Impact from Advanced Search and Filtering** Mitigation: Use
   efficient search algorithms, caching strategies, and lazy loading for complex
   filtering operations

3. **User Experience Consistency Across Exploration Features** Mitigation:
   Maintain consistent design patterns and navigation flows throughout all
   exploration interfaces

4. **Backend Load from Complex Search and Recommendation Queries** Mitigation:
   Implement efficient indexing, query optimization, and caching for search and
   recommendation services

5. **Product Data Quality and Completeness for Advanced Features** Mitigation:
   Establish data quality standards and validation processes for product
   information and sustainability metrics

6. **User Adoption of Advanced Exploration Features** Mitigation: Provide clear
   onboarding, tutorials, and gradual feature introduction to encourage adoption

## Alternative Approaches

1. **AI-First Exploration**: Focus primarily on AI-powered discovery and
   recommendations rather than manual exploration tools
2. **Category-Centric Discovery**: Organize exploration around material
   categories and recycling types rather than general product browsing
3. **Story-Driven Exploration**: Emphasize product journey and transformation
   stories as the primary exploration method
4. **Community-Curated Discovery**: Focus on community-driven product
   collections and social discovery features
5. **Minimal Enhancement**: Improve existing CraftsSection with basic search and
   filtering without comprehensive exploration features
