# Recycling Project Request Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive "Recycling Project Request" feature in the Sirkulo
React Native app that allows users to post requests for specific recycling
projects (such as making chairs from plastic waste) and enables recyclers to bid
on these projects. This feature will integrate with the existing three-mode user
system, backend project management infrastructure, and established bidding
system to create a collaborative recycling marketplace.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Recycling Project Request Data Models**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Define TypeScript interfaces for project requests extending existing
     ProjectStatus enum from sirkulo-backend\src\types\index.ts:80 and BidStatus

   - Status: Not Started

9. **Add User Mode Access Control for Project Requests**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Implement role-based access control where Customers can post
     requests and Recyclers can bid, building upon existing UserMode system

   - Status: Not Started

10. **Integrate Project Communication System**

    - Notes: Connect project requests with existing chat system for
      customer-recycler communication during bidding and project execution

## Verification Criteria

- Users can successfully create recycling project requests with detailed
  specifications, reference images, and budget ranges
- Project category system provides comprehensive options for furniture,
  decorative items, and functional objects
- Recyclers can browse, filter, and bid on project requests with detailed
  proposals and timelines
- Bidding system allows multiple recyclers to compete with transparent bid
  comparison for customers
- Project award process establishes clear contracts and milestone tracking for
  project execution
- Communication system enables seamless customer-recycler interaction throughout
  project lifecycle
- User mode access control properly restricts project posting to customers and
  bidding to recyclers
- Backend integration handles project requests, bids, and status updates with
  appropriate error handling
- Project completion integrates with user achievements and environmental impact
  metrics
- Performance remains optimal with multiple concurrent project requests and
  bidding activities

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Project Scope Complexity and Unclear Requirements** Mitigation: Implement
   structured project templates with clear specification fields and reference
   image requirements

2. **Bid Quality and Recycler Verification Concerns** Mitigation: Add recycler
   portfolio showcase, rating system, and verification badges for bid
   credibility

3. **Project Timeline and Delivery Management** Mitigation: Implement
   milestone-based payment system and clear project timeline tracking with
   automated reminders

4. **Customer-Recycler Communication and Dispute Resolution** Mitigation:
   Integrate structured communication templates and escalation procedures for
   project disputes

5. **Backend Load from Multiple Concurrent Projects and Bids** Mitigation:
   Implement efficient caching, pagination, and real-time update optimization
   for project browsing

6. **Project Request Spam and Low-Quality Submissions** Mitigation: Add project
   request validation, minimum requirements, and community moderation features

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Template-Based Project Creation**: Provide pre-designed project templates
   for common recycling projects instead of free-form requests
2. **Auction-Style Bidding**: Implement time-limited auction bidding rather than
   open bid submission for project requests
3. **Collaborative Project Funding**: Allow multiple users to co-fund larger
   recycling projects instead of individual project requests
4. **AI-Assisted Project Matching**: Use machine learning to automatically match
   project requests with suitable recyclers based on skills and materials
5. **Community Project Voting**: Add community voting system for project
   requests to prioritize high-impact recycling initiatives
