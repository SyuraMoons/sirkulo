## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### 1. **Mode-Based Feature Complexity**
   **Risk**: Complex feature matrix across 3 modes increasing development complexity
   **Mitigation**: Implement shared AI infrastructure with mode-specific feature flags

### 2. **AI Service Integration Complexity**
   **Risk**: Multiple AI services for different features affecting integration timeline
   **Mitigation**: Start with single AI provider, use abstraction layer for future expansion

### 3. **Performance Impact Across Modes**
   **Risk**: AI features causing different performance impacts per mode
   **Mitigation**: Mode-specific performance optimization, lazy loading of AI features

### 4. **Access Control and Security**
   **Risk**: AI features bypassing existing mode-based access control
   **Mitigation**: Integrate with existing authentication system, validate mode permissions

### 5. **User Experience Consistency**
   **Risk**: Inconsistent AI experience across different modes
   **Mitigation**: Design system approach, shared AI UI components with mode variants

### 6. **Data Privacy by Mode**
   **Risk**: Different privacy requirements for Customer vs Business vs Recycler data
   **Mitigation**: Mode-specific data handling policies, granular privacy controls

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Unified AI Service Approach**
   - **Pros**: Single integration point, consistent API, easier maintenance
   - **Cons**: May not optimize for mode-specific needs, potential feature limitations
   - **Best for**: Rapid prototyping, consistent user experience

### 2. **Mode-Specific AI Services**
   - **Pros**: Optimized for each mode's needs, specialized capabilities
   - **Cons**: Multiple integrations, increased complexity, higher costs
   - **Best for**: Advanced features, mode-specific optimization

### 3. **Hybrid Approach with Feature Flags**
   - **Pros**: Flexible deployment, A/B testing capabilities, gradual rollout
   - **Cons**: Increased configuration complexity, testing overhead
   - **Best for**: Phased deployment, user feedback integration

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**
   - **Pros**: Start simple, add complexity gradually, lower risk
   - **Cons**: Longer timeline to full feature set, potential user expectation gaps
   - **Best for**: Stable development, user adoption focus
