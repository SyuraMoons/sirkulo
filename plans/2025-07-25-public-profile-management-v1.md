# Public Profile Management Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive "Public Profile Management" feature in the Sirkulo
React Native app that allows users to control their public profile visibility,
customize their professional presentation, and manage privacy settings across
different user modes (Customer, Business, Recycler). This feature will enhance
the existing profile system with public/private visibility controls,
professional portfolio features, and privacy management tools while building
upon the current profile structure and verification systems.

## Implementation Plan

## Verification Criteria

- Users can control visibility of all profile elements including achievements,
  impact statistics, contact information, and activity history
- Public profile view displays only information that users have explicitly made
  public while respecting privacy settings
- User mode-specific features provide appropriate professional presentation for
  Businesses and Recyclers with portfolio capabilities
- Privacy settings are granular and allow fine-tuned control over different
  types of information visibility
- Profile customization tools enable professional presentation with bio,
  showcase sections, and highlights
- Verification and trust indicators display appropriately based on user privacy
  preferences
- Contact and communication settings protect user privacy while enabling
  appropriate networking
- Profile sharing features work seamlessly with QR codes and shareable links
- Integration with existing systems maintains functionality while respecting
  privacy settings
- Backend integration securely stores privacy preferences and enforces
  visibility controls

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Privacy Settings Complexity and User Confusion** Mitigation: Implement
   progressive disclosure with clear default settings and simple privacy presets
   (Public, Professional, Private)

2. **Profile Information Inconsistency Across Views** Mitigation: Use
   centralized profile data management with consistent privacy enforcement
   across all profile displays

3. **Professional Portfolio Quality and Verification** Mitigation: Provide
   portfolio templates, guidelines, and optional verification for professional
   credentials and project claims

4. **Backend Privacy Enforcement and Data Security** Mitigation: Implement
   robust server-side privacy controls with audit logging and regular security
   reviews

5. **User Mode Switching and Profile Consistency** Mitigation: Design mode-aware
   privacy settings that maintain appropriate professional presentation across
   user mode changes

6. **Public Profile Discovery and Spam Prevention** Mitigation: Implement
   controlled discovery features with reporting mechanisms and moderation tools

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Simple Visibility Toggle**: Provide basic public/private toggle instead of
   granular privacy controls for easier user experience
2. **Template-Based Public Profiles**: Offer pre-designed profile templates for
   different user modes rather than full customization
3. **LinkedIn-Style Professional Focus**: Emphasize professional networking
   features over general social profile management
4. **Community-Moderated Profiles**: Use community reporting and moderation
   instead of individual privacy controls for profile management
5. **QR-Code Centric Sharing**: Focus primarily on QR code-based profile sharing
   for in-person networking rather than comprehensive online discovery
