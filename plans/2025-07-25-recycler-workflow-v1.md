# Recycler Workflow Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive recycler workflow in the Sirkulo React Native app that
addresses all key recycler interaction points: waste collection management,
material processing tracking, inventory management, business partnership
coordination, sustainability impact reporting, and marketplace integration. This
plan creates an integrated recycler journey from waste acquisition to processed
material distribution with emphasis on efficiency, transparency, and circular

   without advanced analytics and optimization
2. **Partnership-Centric Model**: Emphasize supplier and buyer relationships
   over internal process optimization
3. **Compliance-First Approach**: Prioritize regulatory adherence and
   documentation over operational efficiency
4. **Technology-Driven Automation**: Focus on IoT integration and automated
   systems over manual management
5. **Sustainability-Centered Operations**: Organize workflow around
   environmental impact measurement and reporting
6. **Financial Performance Priority**: Emphasize profitability tracking and cost
   optimization over operational features
7. **Marketplace Integration Focus**: Prioritize material sales and distribution
   over internal processing management
