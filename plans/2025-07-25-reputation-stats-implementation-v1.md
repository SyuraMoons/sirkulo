# Reputation & Stats Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive "Reputation & Stats" system in the Sirkulo React
Native app that provides detailed user credibility metrics, performance
statistics, and trust indicators. This feature will enhance the existing profile
system with sophisticated reputation tracking, building upon current
achievements, environmental impact stats, verification badges, and rating
systems to create a robust trust and performance measurement framework.

    - Status: Not Started

11. **Integrate Reputation with Existing Rating Systems**
    - Dependencies: Task 1, 2, 6
    - Notes: Connect existing product and service ratings with overall user
      reputation calculation
    - Files: Enhanced rating integration, reputation-rating correlation system
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Create Reputation Privacy and Control Settings**
    - Dependencies: Task 2, 8, 9
    - Notes: Add user controls for reputation visibility, privacy settings, and
      trust sharing preferences
    - Files: `src/features/reputation/ReputationPrivacy.tsx`,
      `src/features/settings/ReputationSettings.tsx`
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- Comprehensive reputation system provides credible trust metrics for all user
  interactions
- Integration with existing profile statistics maintains current functionality
  while adding reputation insights
- User role-specific reputation tracking provides relevant metrics for Customer,
  Business, and Recycler activities
- Achievement system integration creates meaningful reputation milestones and
  recognition
- Environmental impact reputation enhances existing sustainability tracking with
  credibility scoring
- Community reputation features enable peer validation and social trust building
- Reputation-based verification system enhances existing verification badges
  with trust levels
- Analytics and insights provide actionable feedback for reputation improvement
- Privacy controls ensure users can manage reputation visibility and sharing
  preferences
- All reputation features follow existing app design patterns and accessibility
  standards

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Reputation Calculation Complexity and Fairness** Mitigation: Implement
   transparent reputation algorithms with clear criteria and regular auditing
   for bias prevention

2. **Integration Disruption with Existing Profile System** Mitigation: Extend
   existing profile patterns rather than replacing, maintain backward
   compatibility with current statistics

3. **Privacy and Trust Concerns with Public Reputation** Mitigation: Implement
   granular privacy controls and user consent for reputation sharing and
   visibility

4. **Gaming and Manipulation of Reputation Scores** Mitigation: Use multiple
   validation sources, implement fraud detection, and create reputation decay
   mechanisms

5. **Performance Impact with Complex Reputation Calculations** Mitigation:
   Implement efficient caching, background calculation processing, and
   progressive reputation loading

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Simple Trust Indicators**: Focus on basic verification badges and rating
   averages rather than complex reputation scoring
2. **Activity-Based Reputation**: Calculate reputation based solely on user
   activity and engagement rather than peer reviews
3. **Blockchain-Based Reputation**: Use decentralized reputation tracking for
   transparency and immutability
4. **Gamified Reputation System**: Emphasize reputation as game-like progression
   with levels, badges, and leaderboards
5. **Professional Network Model**: Structure reputation similar to LinkedIn
   endorsements and professional recommendations
