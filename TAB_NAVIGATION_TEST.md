# Tab Navigation Test Summary

## Current Implementation

The tab navigation has been fixed with the following structure:

### Basic Mode (Default):

- Home ✅
- Cart ✅ (href: '/cart')
- Messages ✅
- Profile ✅
- Business Management ❌ (href: null - hidden)

### Recycler Mode:

- Home ✅
- Cart ✅ (href: '/cart')
- Messages ✅
- Profile ✅
- Business Management ❌ (href: null - hidden)

### Business Mode:

- Home ✅
- Cart ❌ (href: null - hidden)
- Messages ✅
- Profile ✅
- Business Management ✅ (href: '/business-management')

## Technical Implementation

Each tab is explicitly defined with conditional `href` properties:

- `href: mode === 'Business' ? null : '/cart'` for Cart tab
- `href: mode === 'Business' ? '/business-management' : null` for Business
  Management tab

This ensures proper hiding/showing of tabs based on user mode.
