## Verification Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- All API endpoints return consistent response formats
- Payment processing completes successfully with proper error handling
- Real-time notifications are delivered within 2 seconds
- Order lifecycle management works correctly for all status transitions
- User authentication and authorization work across all roles
- File uploads are processed and stored securely

### Performance Requirements
- API response times under 200ms for cached requests
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Redis caching reduces database load by 60%
- System handles 1000+ concurrent users
- File upload processing completes within 30 seconds

### Security Requirements
- All sensitive data is properly encrypted
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (100 requests/minute per user)
- File uploads are validated and sanitized
- JWT tokens are properly validated and refreshed
- Audit logs capture all critical operations

### Quality Requirements
- Test coverage above 80% for all critical paths
- All code passes TypeScript strict mode compilation
- ESLint rules are followed consistently
- API documentation is complete and accurate
- Error messages are user-friendly and informative

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### 1. **Payment Integration Complexity**
**Risk**: Xendit API integration may have unexpected complexities or regional limitations
**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive error handling, create fallback payment methods, and thoroughly test in sandbox environment

### 2. **Database Performance Under Load**
**Risk**: Complex queries and large datasets may cause performance issues
**Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing strategy, add query optimization, use Redis caching, and monitor query performance

### 3. **Real-time Feature Scalability**
**Risk**: Socket.IO connections may not scale well with increased user base
**Mitigation**: Implement Redis adapter for Socket.IO clustering, add connection pooling, and consider message queue for high-volume notifications

### 4. **Security Vulnerabilities**
**Risk**: File uploads and user-generated content may introduce security risks
**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive input validation, file type restrictions, virus scanning, and regular security audits

### 5. **Third-party Service Dependencies**
**Risk**: External services (Xendit, Firebase, email providers) may experience downtime
**Mitigation**: Implement circuit breaker patterns, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation strategies

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Microservices Architecture**: Break down the monolithic structure into separate services for payments, notifications, analytics, etc. This would improve scalability but increase deployment complexity.

### 2. **GraphQL API**: Replace REST endpoints with GraphQL for more flexible data fetching. This would reduce over-fetching but require client-side changes.

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement event sourcing and CQRS patterns for better scalability and audit trails. This would improve performance but increase architectural complexity.

### 4. **Serverless Functions**: Move certain operations (image processing, email sending) to serverless functions. This would reduce infrastructure costs but increase vendor lock-in.

### 5. **NoSQL Database**: Consider MongoDB for certain features like analytics and logging. This would improve flexibility but require maintaining multiple database systems.
