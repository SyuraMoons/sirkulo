## Gemini API Integration Details

### **Setup and Configuration**
- **Package**: `@google/genai` for Node.js/TypeScript
- **Installation**: `npm install @google/genai`
- **Authentication**: Environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- **Recommended Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash` (fast, cost-effective, multimodal)

### **Key Features for Marketplace Assistant**
- **Text Generation**: Product descriptions, recommendations, project guidance
- **Long Context**: Maintain conversation history and user preferences
- **Structured Output**: Generate JSON responses for product recommendations
- **Function Calling**: Integrate with existing search, cart, and order APIs
- **Thinking Mode**: Enhanced reasoning for complex product matching (can be disabled for speed)

### **Sample Integration Code Structure**
```typescript
// Basic Gemini client setup
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

// Generate marketplace recommendations
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  contents: `User wants to create a tool from recycled plastic bottles. 
             Recommend 3 products from our marketplace that would be suitable.`,
  config: {
    thinkingConfig: { thinkingBudget: 0 } // Disable for speed
  }
});
```

### **Cost Considerations**
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Most cost-effective option
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting support
- **Context Caching**: Available for repeated conversations
- **Token Optimization**: Efficient prompt engineering

## Verification Criteria
- AI chatbot responds to user queries within 3 seconds using Gemini API
- Recommendation accuracy rate above 70% based on user feedback
- Conversation context maintained across multiple exchanges using Gemini's context capabilities
- Integration with existing marketplace search and order systems
- Real-time messaging experience with typing indicators
- User preference learning improves recommendations over time
- Transaction facilitation increases conversion rates by 15%
- System handles concurrent AI conversations without performance degradation

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. **Gemini API Costs**
   - Mitigation: Use gemini-2.5-flash model, implement intelligent caching, request optimization, usage monitoring

2. **Response Time Performance**
   - Mitigation: Disable thinking mode for speed, implement response streaming, pre-computed recommendations

3. **AI Hallucination/Inaccurate Recommendations**
   - Mitigation: Implement validation layers, structured output constraints, user feedback loops

4. **API Rate Limiting**
